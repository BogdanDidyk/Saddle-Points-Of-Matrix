# Saddle Points Of Matrix
This code implements an algorithm for finding the saddle points of a matrix.

## Example
Suppose we have the following matrix. Need to find saddle points:

[4   0   9]  
[**8**   9   8]  
[4   3   1]  

There is only one saddle point here â€” the value 8, since it's the minimum among all the elements of the row (8, 9, 8) and the maximum value of the corresponding column (4, 8, 4).
